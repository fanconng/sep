Timetable:

22.03. - first meeting @ (Moserhofgasse 34/9 || Tribeka) ?
soft deadline - 26.03. 23:59
27.03. - 18:00 D1-meeting @ Moserhofgasse 34/9
08.04. - 14:00 D2-meeting @ Tribeka 

What we might want to change:
(1) Adding a .css-file?
(2) How do we want to design our html files?
(3) Im not sure how we want to print the boolean functions (isItStormy, ...)

How to see our file in action:
$:while (true):
while> do
while>./a.out
while>sleep 3
while>done

this will create a new condition.hmtl every 3 seconds! (currently there is a cout in order to let you know whenever 
a new file is created!)
Somehow the refreshing does not work as I expect it to do, so you might need to refresh manually!
